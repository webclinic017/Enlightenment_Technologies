# Augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADF Test) is a common statistical test used to test 
# whether a given Time series is stationary or not. It is one of the most commonly 
# used statistical test when it comes to analyzing the stationary of a series.

# the ADF test is fundamentally a statistical significance test. That means, there 
# is a hypothesis testing involved with a null and alternate hypothesis and as a 
# result a test statistic is computed and p-values get reported. It is from the test 
# statistic and the p-value, you can make an inference as to whether a given series is stationary or not.

# A key point to remember here is: Since the null hypothesis assumes the presence of unit 
# root, that is Î±=1, the p-value obtained should be less than the significance level (
# say 0.05) in order to reject the null hypothesis. Thereby, inferring that the series 
# is stationary. However, this is a very common mistake analysts commit with this test. 
# That is, if the p-value is less than significance level, people mistakenly take the 
# series to be non-stationary.

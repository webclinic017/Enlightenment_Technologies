# Quantitative_Finance
Predicting Stocks, RL Portolio Managament, and Automated Trading

# To-Do: First 
âœ“ Make code which can investigate the parameter space of window size, batch size and etc. 
- Preprocess Stock data better - fractionally differentiate sequentially price data
- Make code to download min-by-min stock data from yfinance and add to exisiting .csv file
- Run code off of .csv's rather than yfinance
- Make code that can analyze multiple stocks as an input to predict a single stock 
- Make code which incorporates statistical information in analysis of stocks

# To-Do: Second
- Write RL Portfolio Management Network
- Run All Code on Google Cloud

# To-Do: Horizon Goals
- Automate Trading Decisions, maybe Threshold Amount Necessitates Human Intervention?
- Automate Broad Analysis, with Daily (Hourly?) Report of Stocks to Watch
- Incorporate Data from Other Sources, Look into More Advanced Deep Learning Models 
- Build in-House Compute to Run Code On
